## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

today, I am going to read one article written by @li2025;

now, we can see all the options of opts_chunk set:

```{r opts_chunk}
str(knitr::opts_chunk$get())
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

but how about tables, let follow that:

```{r}
data <- faithful[1:4, ]
knitr::kable(data, caption = "table with kable")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
